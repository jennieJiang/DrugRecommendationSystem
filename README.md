Disease Prediction and Drug Recommendation System

The objective of this Data Mining project is to design and implement a universal Disease
Prediction and Drug Recommendation System that applies various Data Mining technologies to
the recommendation system. By combining information from different sources we are using
various prediction algorithms along with NLP for sentiment analysis and recommendation. Rest
of the report talks about Data Gathering, Pre-processing, Methodology, Results and Conclusion
